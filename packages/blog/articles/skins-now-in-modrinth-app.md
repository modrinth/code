We're thrilled to roll out Modrinth App **v0.10** with a beta release of one of our most highly requested features, the **Skins page**. The Skins page allows you to manage all of your Minecraft skins directly within Modrinth App. You can see all your saved custom skins and the default Minecraft skins in one convenient place.

Adding a new skin is simple, even Herobrine could do it! When you add or edit a skin, you can **upload** your custom texture file directly from your computer, **choose** between the wide or slim arm style to match your preferred character model, and even **assign** a specific cape to that look for the perfect finishing touch.

The interface makes it easy to preview your changes in real-time with the animated player model, so you can see exactly how your skin will look in-game before saving it.
