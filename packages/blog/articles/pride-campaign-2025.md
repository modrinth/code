What an incredible Pride Month! This June, we came together to support [The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/), an essential organization providing crisis support and life-saving resources for LGBTQ+ young people. We are absolutely thrilled to announce that our community raised a stellar **$2,395**. That's not all, though — during the campaign, some donations were matched by H&M and the Trevor Project's Board of Directors up to **six times**, meaning the final impact of Modrinth's donations is a whopping **$8,464**. Our team was also in the top ten for most funds raised this year!

To put your generosity into perspective, a donation this size can fund hundreds of hours on The Trevor Project's 24/7 crisis hotline. It gives young people a lifeline in their hardest moments and supports important educational services for many others.

We couldn't have done it without you. To every person who donated, shared the post, or simply cheered us on from the sidelines — thank you. We are incredibly proud of what we've achieved together as a community.

While Pride Month provides a special opportunity to focus our efforts, the need for these critical resources continues all year long. The challenges faced by LGBTQ+ young people do not end on July 1st, and organizations like The Trevor Project require ongoing support to continue their life-saving work. If you are able, we encourage you to consider making a contribution at any time.

As part of this campaign, we also added the option to donate part of a Modrinth rewards balance to a variety of charities. This means Modrinth creators can directly use the revenue they earned from ads and [Modrinth+](/plus) to donate to dozens of causes close to their heart. The Trevor Project is one option, alongside other prominent non-profits such as the American Cancer Society, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Doctors Without Borders, and the Southern Poverty Law Center. You can donate your Modrinth balance to these groups and many more by clicking the "Withdraw" button on [your revenue dashboard](/dashboard/revenue).

Modrinth's June 2025 campaign will be kept for posterity at [this link](https://modrinth.com/pride).
