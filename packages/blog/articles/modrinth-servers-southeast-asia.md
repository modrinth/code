We're happy to announce that we have just launched [Modrinth Servers](https://modrinth.gg) in one of the most highly anticipated regions: Southeast Asia.

What does this mean for you?

- Lower latency and smoother gameplay for players across Asia and nearby regions
- More choice when creating new servers—Singapore is available as a region starting today
- Room to grow as we continue rolling out infrastructure where you need it most

This launch is a big step in bringing Modrinth Servers closer to more of the community. And we’re just getting started.
