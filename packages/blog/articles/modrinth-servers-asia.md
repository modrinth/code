We're happy to announce that we have just launched [Modrinth Servers](https://modrinth.gg) in one of the most highly anticipated regions: Southeast Asia.

### What does this mean for me?

- Lower latency and smoother gameplay for players across Asia and nearby regions.
- More choice when creating new servers — Singapore is available as a region starting today.
- Room to grow as we continue rolling out infrastructure where you need it most.

This launch is a big step in bringing Modrinth Servers closer to more of our community. And we’re just getting started.

In the next few months, we hope to unveil some exciting new changes to Modrinth Servers that will fundamentally change how you host Minecraft servers. Stay tuned and thank you all for your support since we launched 10 months ago!
