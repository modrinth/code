Hi everyone,

We want to be upfront about censorship on the Modrinth platform. Recently, the Russian government contacted us and required us to restrict LGBTQ+ projects for Russian users. If we didnâ€™t, they threatened to block Modrinth entirely in Russia.

This is not a decision we believe in. It goes against our values and what we stand for as a community. But we were put in an impossible position: either comply, or cut off every single creator and player in Russia. Thatâ€™s not a fair choice, and it doesnâ€™t make us feel any better about having to go through with it.

**To be clear:** Modrinth supports the LGBTQ+ community. We always have, and we always will. If youâ€™re part of this community, know that we see you, we value you, and weâ€™re not going anywhere ðŸ’š. Modrinth will always be a safe home for you, and weâ€™ll keep directly supporting the LGBTQ+ community through our annual Pride campaign fundraiser.

This sucks, and it hurts to be forced into this situation. But you deserve the truth, and we want you to hear it directly from us: **certain LGBTQ+ content on Modrinth will now be restricted in Russia.**
