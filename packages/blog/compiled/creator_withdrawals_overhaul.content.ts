export const html = `<p>Hey everyone!</p><p>We've heard your feedback on creator withdrawal options, and I'm excited to share that more are finally coming to Modrinth! Over the past month, we've been working on overhauling the withdrawal experience and supporting more withdraw methods.</p><p><strong>This update will roll out later this week</strong>, but we wanted to give everyone an early heads-up. There's a lot packed into this release, so let's dive in!</p><modrinth-video data-src="/news/article/creator-withdrawals-overhaul/withdraw-page.webm" data-width="25%" data-height="auto" data-class="rounded-xl"></modrinth-video><h3><strong>TL;DR</strong></h3><ul><li>New revenue page and withdrawal flow</li><li>New bank transfer option for 29 countries</li><li>New crypto (USDC) option for hard to reach countries</li><li>PayPal and Venmo moved to Tremendous for international users (lower to no FX fees)</li><li>Email notifications for payout updates (available, successful, failed, etc.)</li><li>New withdrawal compliance</li></ul><h1>Withdrawal Flow</h1><p>A big goal for this release was to make payouts as clear as possible for creators. The revenue screen and withdrawal process has been completely overhauled.</p><h3>Revenue at a Glance</h3><p>Your revenue is now displayed as a balance, with a detailed breakdown below.</p><p>Green shows available revenue, blue and purple show estimated revenue from the last two completed months, and grey shows the current month revenue that's still being processed.</p><modrinth-video data-src="/news/article/creator-withdrawals-overhaul/balance-progress-bar.webm" data-width="50%" data-height="auto"></modrinth-video><h3>Simplified Withdrawals</h3><p>Withdrawing from your balance now uses a new modal flow. Click the green Withdraw button to start, and you'll immediately see all available methods and fees for your country.</p><modrinth-video data-src="/news/article/creator-withdrawals-overhaul/withdraw-example.webm" data-width="50%" data-height="auto"></modrinth-video><h3>Transaction History</h3><p>We've also cleaned up the transaction history. You'll now see your most recent transactions directly on the home page, along with any deposits from Modrinth into your account.</p><h1>New Withdraw Methods</h1><p>The second big goal of this release was to bring more options, better fees, and new ways to withdraw from countries that were previously hard to reach.</p><h3>Bank Transfers (29 Countries)</h3><p>You can now withdraw directly to your bank account via wire or ACH, depending on your country. Supported countries and their fees are listed below.</p><p>We're working to expand this list, most notably to Canada, the UK, and countries across Asia, but there's no timeline <em>yet</em>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Country</th><th>Currency</th><th>Transaction Fee</th><th>FX Fee</th><th><strong>Total Fee</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ USA</td><td>USD</td><td>$0.50 + 1%</td><td>0.50%</td><td><strong>~1.5% + $0.50</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º EU</td><td>EUR</td><td>â‚¬1.00 + 1%</td><td>0.60%</td><td><strong>~1.6% + â‚¬1.00</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· Argentina</td><td>ARS</td><td>$0.00 + 1%</td><td>0.50%</td><td><strong>~1.5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½ Mexico</td><td>MXN</td><td>$0.50 + 1%</td><td>0.90%</td><td><strong>~1.9% + $0.50</strong></td></tr><tr><td>ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil</td><td>BRL</td><td>$0.25 + 1%</td><td>1.30% (incl.

This option is available worldwide, so everyone can now withdraw funds. Fees are a flat 1% + network fees, making it a great low-cost option.</p><h3>PayPal &amp; Venmo</h3><p>We've moved PayPal and Venmo to two different methods depending on your country:</p><ul><li><p><strong>United States:</strong></p><p>PayPal and Venmo will remain on the existing system with the same fees: $0.25 + 2%, capped at $1.00. ðŸ˜Ž</p></li><li><p><strong>International:</strong></p><p>PayPal and Venmo have been moved to Tremendous, which has zero FX fees and charges a flat 6%, capped at $25.00. This should be an improvement over the old method for larger creators.</p></li></ul><h1>New Emails</h1><p>Earlier this month, we quietly rolled out a new email system that lets us give both creators and users better feedback about what's going on.</p><p>This includes emails for things like project status changes, payouts available, and successful withdrawals. We plan to keep building on this and will be adding email preference settings soon!</p><h1>Tax Compliance</h1><p>Last but not least, we're also rolling out our new tax compliance system. We partially rolled this out earlier this month, but the full version is now live.</p><p>Creator withdrawals will now be limited to $600.00 USD per calendar year for 2025, with this limit set to increase in 2026 (up to the US government). When a creator approaches that threshold, they'll be prompted to fill out a W-8 or W-9 tax form, depending on their country.</p><p>![./tax-compliance-modal.png](Tax compliance modal)</p><p>Completing this form helps Modrinth stay compliant and will automatically unlock withdrawals again once submitted.</p><hr><p>Thank you to all the creators and players supporting Modrinth, we hope you enjoy this long deserved update! ðŸ’š</p>`;
