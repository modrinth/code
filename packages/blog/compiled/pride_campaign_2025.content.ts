export const html = `<p>What an incredible Pride Month! This June, we came together to support <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The Trevor Project</a>, an essential organization providing crisis support and life-saving resources for LGBTQ+ young people. We are absolutely thrilled to announce that our community raised a stellar <strong>$2,395</strong>. That's not all, though — during the campaign, some donations were matched by H&amp;M and the Trevor Project's Board of Directors up to <strong>six times</strong>, meaning the final impact of Modrinth's donations is a whopping <strong>$8,464</strong>. Our team was also in the top ten for most funds raised this year!</p><p>To put your generosity into perspective, a donation this size can fund hundreds of hours on The Trevor Project's 24/7 crisis hotline. It gives young people a lifeline in their hardest moments and supports important educational services for many others.</p><p>We couldn't have done it without you. To every person who donated, shared the post, or simply cheered us on from the sidelines — thank you. We are incredibly proud of what we've achieved together as a community.</p><p>While Pride Month provides a special opportunity to focus our efforts, the need for these critical resources continues all year long. The challenges faced by LGBTQ+ young people do not end on July 1st, and organizations like The Trevor Project require ongoing support to continue their life-saving work. If you are able, we encourage you to consider making a contribution at any time.</p><p>As part of this campaign, we also added the option to donate part of a Modrinth rewards balance to a variety of charities. This means Modrinth creators can directly use the revenue they earned from ads and <a href="/plus" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Modrinth+</a> to donate to dozens of causes close to their heart. The Trevor Project is one option, alongside other prominent non-profits such as the American Cancer Society, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Doctors Without Borders, and the Southern Poverty Law Center.
