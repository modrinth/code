They’re deeply integrated into the platform and app in ways that make playing seamless.</p><p>We genuinely believe modded is the future of large-scale multiplayer Minecraft so lets jump in!</p><p><img src="/news/article/server-projects-available-now/Server%20projects%20blog/image.png" alt="[Video] Server discovery in app &gt; play &gt; join server"></p><p>[Video] Server discovery in app &gt; play &gt; join server</p><h3>Tl;dr</h3><ul><li>New Server Project type</li><li>Three compatibility types: vanilla, modded (published pack), or modded (uploaded pack)</li><li>Joining a server from App downloads the require content and launches you directly into the server</li><li>New linked server instance type and receive updates from server</li><li>Server Projects are not eligible for payouts</li></ul><h2>Design Goals</h2><p>Let’s start with why we built this.</p><p>Most of the fun in Minecraft happens with other people, but getting into a modded multiplayer experience is still harder than it should be. We think this is the future of multiplayer for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Modding enables far deeper experiences than server-side plugins ever will.</li><li>The real constraint has been distribution and setup. Players have to find the server, install the right content, keep it updated, and hope everything matches.</li><li>Multiplayer discovery in Minecraft has never been great. It should be easier to join a server, and just as easy to join a modded one.</li></ul><p>Additionally, modpack discovery has become noisy on Modrinth. Servers fork popular packs with small tweaks and climb discovery, which crowds out original creators.</p><h2>Project Creation</h2><p>Server projects are different from other project types because they don’t always have uploaded files. Instead, servers define their compatibility, which can include specifying any required content.</p><p>For the initial release we support two compatibility models: vanilla and required modpack. We also have ideas to expand this with a minimum requirements model in the future. Authors would define the required mod and version needed to join and could recommend modpacks that work as-well.</p><p>When setting up your server project, you define this in the Server Compatibility section. It comes in three types:</p><ul><li>Vanilla server</li><li>Modded server (published Modrinth pack)</li><li>Modded server (uploaded custom pack)</li></ul><p>Each type defines different requirements to join. Vanilla servers specify supported and recommended Minecraft versions. Modded servers either link a Modrinth pack or upload a custom pack, which enforces the version and mod loader required.</p><p><img src="/news/article/server-projects-available-now/Server%20projects%20blog/image.png" alt="[Video] Compatibility type config"></p><p>[Video] Compatibility type config</p><p>Server Projects also introduce some new fields used for discovery and project pages:</p><ul><li>Banner</li><li>Country (where it is hosted)</li><li>Language</li><li>Java address</li><li>Bedrock address (not used yet)</li><li>Server compatibility</li></ul><p>Additionally, Server Projects are the only project type <strong>not eligible for payouts</strong>. They do not earn revenue from views or downloads on the project itself. Any required content they point to, such as a modpack, receives the download and associated revenue.</p><h2>Project Discovery</h2><p>Server projects use two new discovery metrics instead of downloads to help surface new servers over time. These are:</p><ul><li><strong>Players online:</strong> The live player count reported by the server.</li><li><strong>Verified plays:</strong> Joins from the Modrinth App in the last two weeks.</li></ul><p><img src="/news/article/server-projects-available-now/Server%20projects%20blog/image.png" alt="[IMG] Server discovery"></p><p>[IMG] Server discovery</p><p>Server Projects also have their own set of filters to make finding the right server easier:</p><ul><li>Type (vanilla vs modded)</li><li>Category</li><li>Game version</li><li>Country</li><li>Language</li></ul><p>Additionally, Server Projects are different from other project types because they’re live experiences. If they aren’t joinable, they don’t provide value. To keep discovery healthy, servers that aren’t pingable for a sustained period are removed from discovery.</p><h2>Joining a Server</h2><p>Joining a server is where this all comes together. While in the App, clicking play on a server triggers different flows depending on the server type:</p><ol><li>Vanilla servers immediately create a fabric instance in the app using the recommended version set by the author.</li><li>Modded servers show a modal which displays the required content. Clicking install creates an instance with the that content.</li></ol><p><img src="/news/article/server-projects-available-now/Server%20projects%20blog/image.png" alt="[IMG] Required content modal"></p><p>Once installation finishes, you’ll see a completion toast which when clicked skips the multiplayer screen and loaders you directly to the server. After the initial setup, clicking play always boots straight into the server.</p><p>Additionally, if you click play from the website, we’ll deep link into the app if it’s installed.</p><h3>Linked Server Instances</h3><p>As mentioned earlier, joining a server creates an instance. These are called linked server instances and are similar to linked modpack instances.</p><p>Key differences:</p><ul><li>It’s linked to a server project, not a modpack project.</li><li>You can only add client-side mods. You can unlink it in settings to convert it into a linked modpack instance, but it will stop receiving server updates.</li><li>It always enforces the required version. If an update is available, you must accept it before launching again.</li></ul><h3>Server Project Updates</h3><p>When a server updates its compatibility, such as publishing a new modpack version, that update is distributed to all linked instances. The next time a player launches, they’re prompted to accept the changes before joining. This keeps the server and and associated instances in sync.</p><p><img src="/news/article/server-projects-available-now/Server%20projects%20blog/image.png" alt="[IMG] Update available modal"></p><p>—</p><p>That’s all from us! Thank you so much for your continued support and happy playing!</p>`;
