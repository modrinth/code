Please see our updated post <a href="/news/article/standing-by-our-values" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> on our choice to stand up to the Russian government.</strong></p><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>We want to be upfront about censorship on the Modrinth platform. Recently, the Russian government contacted us and required us to restrict LGBTQ+ projects for Russian users. If we didnâ€™t, they threatened to block Modrinth entirely in Russia.</p><p>This is not a decision we believe in. It goes against our values and what we stand for as a community. But we were put in an impossible position: either comply, or cut off every single creator and player in Russia. Thatâ€™s not a fair choice, and it doesnâ€™t make us feel any better about having to go through with it.</p><p><strong>To be clear:</strong> Modrinth supports the LGBTQ+ community. We always have, and we always will. If youâ€™re part of this community, know that we see you, we value you, and weâ€™re not going anywhere ðŸ’š. Modrinth will always be a safe home for you, and weâ€™ll keep directly supporting the LGBTQ+ community through our annual Pride campaign fundraiser.</p><p>This sucks, and it hurts to be forced into this situation. But you deserve the truth, and we want you to hear it directly from us: <strong>certain LGBTQ+ content on Modrinth will now be restricted in Russia.</strong></p>`;
