  '<p>Over the few months, Modrinth has seen incredible interest towards our Servers product, and with significant growth, our vision for what Modrinth Servers can be has evolved alongside it. To continue striving towards our goal of providing the best place to get your own Minecraft multiplayer server, we’ve made the decision to bring our server hosting fully in-house.</p><h3>Why We\'re Making This Change</h3><p>Modrinth has some ambitious goals for the next year. We want to create the best possible way for all Java players play Minecraft, and to host and play their favorite modpacks and custom servers. To achieve this, it’s clear that Modrinth Servers needs to be built and scaled on our own infrastructure.</p><p>By running every aspect of our hosting platform, we gain the flexibility to tailor the experience to our community’s needs—whether that means deeper integrations with Modrinth’s ecosystem, better performance, or more innovative features. This also allows us to invest in the long-term sustainability of Modrinth Servers, ensuring that we can scale seamlessly and avoid running out of available servers stock.</p><h3>A Thank You to Pyro</h3><p>This change is purely a logistical step forward and does not reflect negatively on our partnership with <a href="https://pyro.host" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pyro</a>. In fact, Pyro has been an incredible partner in getting Modrinth Servers off the ground and we are very grateful for their collaboration. We completely support Pyro and their future, and we know they’re working on some exciting new products of their own, which we can’t wait to check out!</p><h3>What This Means for You</h3><p>We know you may have questions, and we want to make this transition as smooth as possible.</p><ul><li><p><strong>What part of my server was being run by Pyro?</strong></p><p>Until this point, Pyro has been responsible for the physical server machines that run your Modrinth servers. This means that they have been responsible for the hardware that powers your server, as well as the files and data for them. Moving forward, all of this will exist under Modrinth.</p></li><li><p><strong>What happens to my running servers?</strong></p><p>Your current servers will continue running, and we’ll provide a clear migration path if any action is needed on your part. You can expect a follow up soon, however our goal is to do this with 0 downtime or impact to you if possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>Will anything else change that impacts me?</strong></p><p>Modrinth Servers will remain the same great experience its has been, you likely won’t notice any changes right away. Long term, this means we’ll be able to improve both the stability of servers as well as the features that make managing your server a breeze.</p></li></ul><p>This is an exciting step toward a future where Modrinth is the go-to destination for Java Minecraft players—not just for mods and mod-packs, but for hosting and playing too. We appreciate your support and can’t wait to share more soon!</p>'
