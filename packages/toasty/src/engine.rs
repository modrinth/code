/// [`Engine`] orchestrates the multi-phase compilation pipeline that transforms
/// user queries into database operations. It owns the schema and capability
/// reference, and provides the main entry point ([`exec`](Self::exec)) for
/// executing statements.
///
/// The execution pipeline follows this process:
///
/// 1. **Normalization.** Expand implicit application-level semantics.
/// 2. **Verification.** Validate statement structure and reject AST shapes
///    the driver does not support.
/// 3. **Lowering.** Convert to HIR with dependency tracking.
/// 4. **Planning.** Build MIR operation graph.
/// 5. **Execution.** Run actions against the database driver. Each
///    driver-bound statement is legalized for the target backend and its
///    bind parameters extracted ([`prepare_for_driver`](Self::prepare_for_driver))
///    immediately before it crosses to the driver.
