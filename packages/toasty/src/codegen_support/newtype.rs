//! Marker trait emitted by `#[derive(Embed)]` for tuple-newtype embeds.
//!
//! The companion blanket impl turns any newtype embed whose inner type
//! implements [`Auto`] into an [`Auto`] type itself, so a user does not need
//! to repeat the strategy on the wrapper:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[derive(toasty::Embed)]
//! struct UserId(uuid::Uuid);
//!
//! // Automatically: `UserId: Auto` because `Uuid: Auto`.
//! ```
//!
//! Newtypes around non-`Auto` types stay non-`Auto` — the blanket's
//! `T::Inner: Auto` bound is on a generic associated type, so it is properly
//! conditional and doesn't error at impl declaration.
//!
//! `NewtypeOf` is local to toasty. Combined with the orphan rule, that keeps
//! the blanket from overlapping with the concrete `impl Auto for u64`,
//! `impl Auto for uuid::Uuid`, etc.: no downstream crate can ever add
//! `impl NewtypeOf for u64`, and toasty itself never will.
