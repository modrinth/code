//! Attaches the variant checks a predicate over an enum variant requires.
//!
//! A path into an enum variant (`contact().email().address()`) converts to an
//! [`ExprVariant`] selection: the variant's payload, without a check that the
//! value holds that variant. A predicate over such an operand only means
//! something for rows of that variant, so normalization conjoins an
//! `is_variant` check for every selection a predicate's operands reach — on
//! either operand, and for every enclosing variant of a nested selection,
//! outermost first.
//!
//! Guards attach at each predicate boundary: the comparison, null check,
//! membership test, or other boolean operator whose operands hold the
//! selection. Boolean connectives and subqueries are boundaries of their own,
//! so `a.eq(b).not()` becomes `NOT (is_variant AND a = b)` and negates the
//! guarded comparison as a whole, while `a.is_some()` — the `IS NOT NULL`
//! predicate — becomes `is_variant AND NOT (a IS NULL)`. A selection used as
//! a value only, such as an ordering expression, stays unguarded.
//!
//! Guards a conjunction already states are not repeated below it, which keeps
//! the rewrite idempotent and lets generated `matches()` filters keep their
//! explicit `is_variant AND body` shape. Conjunctions produced by the rewrite
//! flatten into the enclosing conjunction so that a guard and the comparison
//! it scopes stay siblings, which relation lifting relies on to fold them
//! into one subquery.
