//! Legalization rule: rewrite `#[document]` path reads into the shape
//! drivers consume.
//!
//! The engine views a document column at the app level: the mapping's raising
//! cast (`Cast(column, Type::Model)`) turns the driver's named `Value::Object`
//! into the embed's positional `Value::Record`, and a path into the document
//! is a positional projection through that cast —
//! `Project(Cast(column, Model), steps)` — which the in-memory interpreter
//! evaluates directly. Drivers and the database schema see only the
//! structural view: the column is typed `Type::Object`, its value is a named
//! `Value::Object`, and a path is a resolved [`stmt::FuncJsonExtract`] name
//! path. The model identity never crosses the driver boundary.
//!
//! Value conversion between the two views is the mapping's job: the schema
//! builder plants a lowering cast (`Model` → `Object`, carrying the source
//! type — see `stmt::ExprCast::from`) in `model_to_table` and the raising
//! cast in `table_to_model`, and the cast machinery (fold/simplify constant
//! folding, `mir::Eval` evaluation) converts values wherever the casts
//! land. What cannot be expressed as a cast is the *path read*: turning a
//! positional projection into a JSON key path is a per-backend expression
//! rewrite (the leaf's comparison form depends on driver capabilities). That
//! makes it a legalization rule rather than a simplifier rewrite (the
//! simplifier runs identically for every backend) or a serializer concern
//! (the statement must already be representable when the driver receives it).
