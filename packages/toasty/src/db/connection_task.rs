//! Per-connection worker task and its message protocol.
//!
//! Each pooled connection is owned by a [`ConnectionTask`] running in a
//! dedicated tokio task; callers interact with it through a
//! [`ConnectionHandle`] by sending [`ConnectionOperation`] messages over
//! an mpsc channel and awaiting a oneshot response. This serializes
//! access to the underlying driver connection — drivers are not
//! required to be `Sync` on `exec` — and gives the connection its own
//! lifecycle independent of the pool object that holds the handle.
