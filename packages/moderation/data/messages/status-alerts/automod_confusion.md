## Warnings from AutoMod

Unfortunately, our AutoMod cannot read your project's Description or your messages to moderation.  
AutoMod will warn both you and our Moderation Staff about potential issues, but if you've already followed the necessary steps these warnings can safely be ignored.  
Note that if your project is being rejected by AutoMod this means your project has content that can not be included in your modpack and must be removed before resubmission, including deleting versions of your modpack that include the content.
