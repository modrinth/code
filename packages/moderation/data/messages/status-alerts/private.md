## Private Use

Under normal circumstances, your project would be rejected due to the issues listed below.  
However, since your project is not intended for public use, these requirements will be waived and your project will be unlisted. This means it will remain accessible through a direct link without appearing in public search results, allowing you to share it privately.  
If you're okay with this, or submitted your project to be unlisted already, than no further action is necessary.  
If you would like to publish your project publicly, please address all moderation concerns before resubmitting this project.
