## Unreachable Links

Per section 5.4 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous) all links must lead to correctly labeled publicly available resources that are directly related to your project.

Currently, your Source link directs to a Page Not Found error, likely because your repository is private, make sure to make your repository public before resubmitting your project!
