Your project's %PROJECT_LICENSE_FLINK% of `%PROJECT_LICENSE_NAME%`, requires source disclosure.  
Consider adding a Source link to your project's repository, or including a Sources file for each version as an Additional File.  
Keep in mind this may be a requirement of the source work's licensing, which must be abided per section 4 of %RULES%.
