## Minecraft Project Names

Projects must not use Minecraft's branding or include "Minecraft" as a significant part of the title.  
Your project's current Name of `%PROJECT_TITLE%` may be confusingly similar to, or imply association with, the game Minecraft. We encourage you to change your project's [Name](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) to avoid a potential violation of Minecraft's Usage Guidelines.  
Abbreviations like "MC" or elaborate titles that do not make the name Minecraft a significant portion of the name are okay.  
When editing your project's Name, remember to update its [URL](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) to match.
