## Project Title

Projects must not use Minecraft's branding or include "Minecraft" as a significant part of the title.

The title of your project may be confusingly similar to the game, and we encourage you to change your title to avoid a potential violation of Minecraft's Usage Guidelines.

Abbreviations like "MC" or elaborate titles that do not make the name Minecraft a significant portion of the name are okay.
