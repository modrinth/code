## Misuse of Title

Per section 5.2 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous) we ask that you limit the title to just the name of your project.

Additional information, such as themes, tags, supported versions or loaders, etc. should be saved for the Summary or Description.

When changing your project title, remember to also ensure that your project slug (URL) matches and accurately represents your project.
