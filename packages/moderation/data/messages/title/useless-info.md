## Misuse of Project Name

Per section 5.2 of %RULES%, your project's [Name](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) should not include unnecessary information such as loaders, themes, tags, or versions.
Your project's current Name of `%PROJECT_TITLE%` appears to contain extra information.  
We ask that you remove all additional information from the [Name](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%). Instead, consider including this in your project's Summary or Description, or as a part of its relevant metadata.  
When editing your project's Name, remember to update its [URL](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) to match.
