## Description Accessibility

Per section 2 of %RULES% your description must be plainly readable and accessible.

Using non-standard text characters like Zalgo or "fancy text" in place of text anywhere in your project, including the Description, Summary, or Title can make your project pages inaccessible.

This is important for users who rely on Screen Readers and for search engines in order to provide relevant results to users. Please remove any instances of this type of text.
