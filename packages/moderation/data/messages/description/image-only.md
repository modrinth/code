## Image Descriptions

In accordance with section 2.2 of %RULES%, we ask that you provide a text alternative to your current Description.

It is important that your Description contains enough detail about your project that a user can have a full understanding of it from text alone.

A text-based transcription allows for those using screen readers, and users with slow internet connections unable to load images to be able to access the contents of your Description. This also acts as a backup in case the image in your Description ever goes offline for some reason.

We appreciate how much effort you put into your Description, but accessibility is important to us at Modrinth, if you would like you could put the transcription of your Description entirely in a `details` tag, so as to not spoil the visuals of your Description.
