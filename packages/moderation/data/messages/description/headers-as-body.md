## Description Accessibility

In accordance with section 2.2 of %RULES%, we request that `# header`s not be used as body text.

Headers are interpreted differently by screen-readers and thus should generally only be used for things like separating sections of your Description.

If you would like to emphasize a particular sentence or paragraph, instead consider using `**bold**` text using the **B** button above the text editor.
