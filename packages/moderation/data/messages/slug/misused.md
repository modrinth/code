## Misuse of custom URL

We ask that you ensure your project's %PROJECT_SLUG_FLINK% accurately represents your project.  
Your current slug of `%PROJECT_SLUG%` may not accurately match your project's Name or contain excess information.  
A mismatched URL may make it more difficult for users to find your content. Abbreviations or similar are fine to use if applicable. If your preferred URL is not available, and you cannot find a matching public project, let us know in this moderation thread when you resubmit your project, and our moderation team may be able to free it up for your project.
