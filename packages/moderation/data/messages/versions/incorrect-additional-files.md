## Incorrect Use of Additional Files

It looks like you've uploaded multiple `mod.jar` files to one Version as Additional Files. Per section 5.7 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous) each Version of your project must include only one `mod.jar` that corresponds to its respective Minecraft and loader versions.

This allows users to easily find and download the file they need for the version they're on with ease. The Additional Files feature can be used for things like a `Sources.jar`.

Please upload each version of your mod separately, thank you.
