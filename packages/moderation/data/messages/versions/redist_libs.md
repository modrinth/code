## Unnecessary redistribution of dependencies

This project appears to include libs or dependencies, unnecessarily redistributing their entire contents.  
This is often due to an error in project structure or compilation, and in some cases, may violate the copyrights or licensing agreements of these libraries.  
We ask that you remove all unnecessary files, assets, and code from your project before resubmission.
