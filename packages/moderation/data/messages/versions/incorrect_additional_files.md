## Incorrect Use of Additional Files

It looks like you've uploaded multiple primary files to one Version as Additional Files. Per section 5.7 of %RULES%, each Version of your project must include only one primary file that corresponds to its respective Minecraft and loader versions.  
This allows users to easily find and download the content they need for their game profile with ease. The Additional Files feature can be used for things like a `Sources.jar`.  
Please upload each version of your project separately, thank you.
