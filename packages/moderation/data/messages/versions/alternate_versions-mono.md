## Unsupported Project

Modrinth does not support uploading projects that have unnecessary or extraneous installation steps.  
Having alternate versions of your content on the same project will hurt the functionality of the Modrinth App and other supported launchers as it would prevent users from updating your content, and may make it harder for your users to find the content they want.  
We ask that you upload each alternate version of your project as a new project, ensuring that all users will be able to access and easily find your content.
