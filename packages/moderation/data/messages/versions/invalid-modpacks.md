## Modpacks on Modrinth

It looks like you've uploaded your Modpack as a `.zip`, unfortunately, this is invalid and is why your project type is "Mod". I recommend taking a look at our support page about [Modrinth Modpacks](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802250-modpacks-on-modrinth), and once you're ready feel free to resubmit your project as a `.mrpack`. Don't forget to delete the old files from your Versions!
