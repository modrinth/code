## Incorrect Additional Files

Per section 5.7 of %RULES%, the additional files section should only be used for specific designated purposes such as a `Sources.jar`.
Modrinth does not support the upload of modpacks in the `.zip` format, as this may cause issues for Modrinth users or distribute copyrighted content without the proper permissions.  
If you would like to upload a server-specific version of your modpack, consider creating a separate Modpack project.
