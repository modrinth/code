## Insufficient Summary

Per section 5.3 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous) your Summary can not include any extra formatting such as lists, or links.

Your project summary should provide a brief overview of your project that informs and entices users.

This is the first thing most people will see about your mod other than the Logo, so it's important it be accurate, reasonably detailed, and exciting.
