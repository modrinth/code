## Environment Information

Per section 5.1 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous), it is important that the metadata of your projects is accurate, including whether the project runs on the client or server side.

For a brief rundown of how this works:

- **Client side** refers to a mod that is only required by the client, like [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium).
- **Server side** mods change the behavior of the server without the client needing the mod, like Datapacks, recipes, or server-side behaviors, like [Falling Tree](https://modrinth.com/mod/fallingtree).
- A mod that adds features, entities, or new blocks and items, generally will be required on **both** the server and the client, for example [Cobblemon](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon).
