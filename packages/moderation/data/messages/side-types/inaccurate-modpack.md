## Incorrect Environment Information

Per section 5.1 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules#miscellaneous), it is important that the metadata of your projects is accurate, including whether the project runs on the client or server side.

For a brief rundown of how this works:

- Some modpacks can be client-side, usually aimed at providing utility and optimization while allowing the player to join an unmodded server, for instance, [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized).
- Most other modpacks that change how the game is played are going to be required on both the client and server, like the modpack [Dying Light](https://modrinth.com/modpack/dying-light).

When in doubt, test for yourself or check the requirements of the mods in your pack.
