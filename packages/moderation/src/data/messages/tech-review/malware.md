## Indefinitely Rejected

A project you uploaded has been found to contain or distribute malicious files, this is strictly prohibited and a violation of [Modrinth's Terms of Use](https://modrinth.com/legal/terms).
Our Moderation team has determined this project, and all projects associated with your account should be rejected indefinitely.
We believe this is the best course of action at this time and ask that you **do not resubmit this project**.
