## Environment Metadata

Per section 5.1 of %RULES%, it is important that the metadata of your projects is accurate, including Environment Information.

We've recently overhauled how environment metadata works on Modrinth, you can now edit this in your project's [Version Settings](https://modrinth.com/project/%PROJECT_ID%/settings/versions).
Please [read this blogpost](%NEW_ENVIRONMENTS_LINK%) for full details and information on how to ensure your project is labeled correctly.
