Thank you for your report, we understand your concerns.

Currently, Modrinth does not prohibit "%TERM%" style mods or consider these to de facto violate section 3 of [Modrinth's Content Rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) due to their considerable legitimate use-cases.
If you have reason to believe a project on Modrinth is intentionally enabling or promoting cheating, we ask that you create a new report and provide sufficient evidence.
