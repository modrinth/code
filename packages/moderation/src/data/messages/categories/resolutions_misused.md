Currently, your pack has multiple Resolutions selected, in most cases, this will misrepresent your project.  
For a brief rundown of how this works:  
Vanilla Minecraft textures like blocks and items have a width and height of 16 pixels.  
This means that packs with textures the same size as the default are considered 16x.  
Some packs make the resolution of textures smaller than the default, such as 8x, and some bigger, such as 32x.
