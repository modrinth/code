## Insufficient Description

Per section 2.1 of %RULES%, your project's Description should clearly inform the reader of the content, purpose, and appeal of your project.

Currently, it looks like there are some missing details.

What does your modpack add? What features does it have? Why would a user want to download it? Be specific!
See descriptions like [Simply Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/sop) or [Aged](https://modrinth.com/modpack/aged) for examples of what a good description looks like.
