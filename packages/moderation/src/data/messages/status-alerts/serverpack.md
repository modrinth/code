## Modded servers on Modrinth

Since your project is intended for use on a specific Minecraft server, we strongly recommend [listing your server with Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/discover/servers).

When creating a server project, you can connect it to any Modpack that already exists on Modrinth, or upload your content as a custom modpack.
Adding a custom modpack to your server will save you time by only needing to manage one lightweight project page, and makes finding, updating, and playing on your server much easier for your players.
