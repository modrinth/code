## Project Branding

Per section 1.8 of %RULES%, your project or its branding must not imply association or be easily confused with any other person or organization.  
We ask that you change your project's [Name](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) and other relevant branding to avoid causing confusion or implying association with existing projects or individuals.  
When editing your project's Name, remember to update its [URL](%PROJECT_SETTINGS_LINK%) to match.
