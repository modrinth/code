## Broken Version

It looks like you've uploaded multiple files with the same name to the same version. This triggers a bug that produces duplicate primary file entries.  
This may cause issues for users and creators as it would prevent Modpacks that include this content from functioning in the Modrinth App and other launchers.  
We ask that you delete and reupload all applicable versions. Be sure to only upload one file to each version before resubmission.
