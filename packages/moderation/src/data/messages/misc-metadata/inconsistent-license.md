## Inconsistent Licensing

Your project's files, source, or listings outside of Modrinth may list licensing information that does not match your %PROJECT_LICENSE_FLINK% settings.
We strongly encourage you to ensure your licensing is listed consistently anywhere your project can be found, and your licensing on Modrinth should match any in-file licensing.
