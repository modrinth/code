## Insufficient Summary

Currently, your summary includes your server's Address, this is redundant information that should instead be appropriately listed in your server's %PROJECT_SETTINGS_FLINK%.

Your server's summary should provide a brief overview of your server that informs and entices players.

This is the first thing most people will see about your listing other than the Icon, so it's important it be accurate, reasonably detailed, and exciting.
