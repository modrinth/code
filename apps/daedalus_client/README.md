# Daedalus

Daedalus is a powerful tool which queries and generates metadata for the Minecraft (and other games in the future!) game
and mod loaders for:

- Performance (Serving static files can be easily cached and is extremely quick)
- Ease for Launcher Devs (Metadata is served in an easy to query and use format)
- Reliability (Provides a versioning system which ensures no breakage with updates)

Daedalus supports the original Minecraft data and reposting for the Forge, Fabric, Quilt, and NeoForge loaders.
