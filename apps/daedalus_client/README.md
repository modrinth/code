# Daedalus 

Daedalus is a powerful tool which queries and generates metadata for the Minecraft (and other games in the future!) game
and mod loaders for:
- Performance (Serving static files can be easily cached and is extremely quick)
- Ease for Launcher Devs (Metadata is served in an easy to query and use format)
- Reliability (Provides a versioning system which ensures no breakage with updates)

Daedalus is currently a work in progress, but will support the original Minecraft data and reposting for all Forge and 
Fabric artifacts.

Once Daedalus is done, Modrinth will provide full documentation for how to query from it and use it for your own launcher!
