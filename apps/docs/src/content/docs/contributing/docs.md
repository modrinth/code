description: Guide for contributing to Modrinth's developer documentation
---

This project is part of our [monorepo](https://github.com/modrinth/code). You can find it in the `apps/docs` directory.

[Docs] are the very site you are looking at right now.
They are here to help developers and contributors work with Modrinth's codebase and API.

To set up a development environment, you will need to install [pnpm] and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run docs:dev
```

When ready, you will have a hot-reloading environment of the docs site running on port 4321.

#### Ready to open a PR?

While there is no linting requirement on Docs, we do ask that you quickly check your writing before contributing.
