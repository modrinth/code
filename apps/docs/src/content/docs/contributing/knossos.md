title: Knossos (Frontend)
description: Guide for contributing to Modrinth's frontend
---

This project is our [monorepo](https://github.com/modrinth/code). You can find the frontend in the `apps/frontend` directory.

[knossos] is the Nuxt.js frontend. You will need to install [pnpm] and run the standard commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run web:dev
```

Once that's done, you'll be serving knossos on `localhost:3000` with hot reloading. You can replace the `dev` in `pnpm run dev` with `build` to build for a production server and `start` to start the server. You can also use `pnpm run lint` to find any eslint problems, and `pnpm run fix` to try automatically fixing those problems.
