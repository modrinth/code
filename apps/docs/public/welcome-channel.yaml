        open forum. First and foremost, this Discord server is intended to facilitate the development of Modrinth and
        for communication regarding Modrinth. Ultimately, it is up to the discretion of the moderators whether your
        messages are in violation of our rules.\n\n
        Modrinth's rules are split up into two categories: the **__DOs__** and the **__DO NOTs__**."

    - title: ":pencil2: Nickname policy:"
      color: 0xffa347
      description: >-
        We want to keep this server clean and therefore require that display names of all members on the server are
        readable, accessible, and free of attention-seeking elements, which includes, but is not limited to, display
        names that begin with hoisting characters, have an excessive number of emojis in them, or use "fancy fonts",
        "glitch effects" and any other Unicode characters, which are either very inaccessible to screen readers or cause
        annoyance to other members.

        When we find that your display name does not adhere to this policy, we will try to correct it by changing your
        nickname on the server. Repetitive attempts to revert to a violating display name may result in your removal
        from the server. We will also permanently remove any users whose profiles contain inappropriate content.
