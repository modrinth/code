# Modrinth Documentation

Welcome to the Modrinth documentation! 

## Development

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

```bash
pnpm install

You should now have a development build of the documentation site running with hot-reloading enabled. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the browser.
