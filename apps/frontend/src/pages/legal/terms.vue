    <h2>Accessing the Service and Account Security</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to withdraw or amend the Service, and any service or material we provide
      through the Service, in our sole discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any
      reason all or any part of the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time
      to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Service, or the entire Service, to users,
      including registered users.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to have access to the
      Service, and ensuring that all persons who access the Service through your internet connection
      are aware of these Terms of Use and comply with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To access the Service or some of the resources it offers, you may be asked to provide certain
      registration details or other information. It is a condition of your use of the Service that
      all the information you provide on the Service is correct, current and complete. You agree
      that all information you provide to register with the Service or otherwise, including but not
      limited to through the use of any interactive features on the Service, is governed by our
      Privacy Policy, and you consent to all actions we take with respect to your information
      consistent with our Privacy Policy.

      you agree to be responsible for and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from any damages
      caused by any such person to whom you provide any such information). You agree to notify us
      immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name or password or any other
      breach of security. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a
      public or shared computer so that others are not able to view or record your password or other
      personal information.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the right to disable any user name, password or other identifier, whether chosen by
      you or provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if,

    </p>
    <h2>About the Service</h2>
    <p>
      The Service allows you to upload and share your gaming content (the "Gaming Content", to be
      distinguished from User Contributions, defined below) with other users of our Service. Unlike
      User Contributions, which are owned by the Company, when you use the Service and upload and
      share your Gaming Content, the Company does not claim any right, title or interest in or to
      your Gaming Content. At the same time, the Company disclaims any and all liability in
      connection with the Gaming Content, and you are solely responsible for any and all claims,
      actions, damages and the like in connection with the Gaming Content.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you upload your Gaming Content, you hereby grant us a limited use, non-exclusive,
      royalty-free, fully paid up, right to display and distribute your Gaming Content to our users
      through the Service, which our users in turn may then use at their sole discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you delete your Gaming Content, you agree that your Gaming Content may continue to be
      used by any users who have previously downloaded your Gaming Content pursuant to the preceding
      license, and you also agree that your Gaming Content may continue to be part of any
      already-existing Gaming Content "packs" created by other users as part of our Service until
      such time as such Gaming Content has been deleted by such user(s) as part of such "pack(s)".
      Otherwise, for the avoidance of doubt, as between the Company and you, you own and will
      continue to own all right, title and interest in and to your Gaming Content.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Gaming Content must abide by the <nuxt-link to="/legal/rules">Content Rules</nuxt-link>.
    </p>
    <h2>API Usage</h2>
    <p>
      As part of our Services, we provide a tool known as Application Programming Interfaces
      (Modrinth API). The Modrinth API enables users to perform actions on the Service via their own
      services, such as their websites and/or applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grant the User of the Modrinth API a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and
      revocable license to download, display, query, create, edit, and delete the User Generated
      Content on the Service via their own services, such as their websites and/or applications (the
      API License), provided the User complies with the following conditions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The User uses the Modrinth API in accordance with these Terms, the Community Standards and
        all applicable laws and regulations that apply to such use.
      </li>
      <li>the User does not infringe any rights of third parties.</li>
      <li>
        the User provides Modrinth all assistance requested in complying with, and concluding all
        agreements required by the applicable laws and regulations.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each User using the Modrinth API shall indemnify Modrinth and keep Modrinth indemnified for
      all claims, proceedings or actions brought by another User or any other third party, including
      governmental authorities.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Rewards Program</h2>
    <p>
      Our rewards program (<strong>"Rewards Program"</strong>) provides developers and content
      creators with an opportunity to monetize the projects that they upload to the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Company pays to you a percentage of net revenue collected by us and attributable to ad
      impressions displayed solely on your project pages. The funds are directly deposited into your
      account, which you can monitor and access via your creator dashboard. Simply enroll in the
      Rewards Program on your dashboard in order to be able to take advantage of this program.
      Please review the <nuxt-link to="/legal/cmp">Rewards Program Terms</nuxt-link>, as it contains
      very important language regarding, among other things, your status as an independent
      contractor, your responsibility to pay taxes, our disclaimers and limitations of liability (in
      addition to our disclaimers and limitations of liability in these Terms of Use).
    </p>
