    <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>

      business purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To fulfill or meet the reason you provided the information. For example, if you share your
        name and contact information to request a price quote or ask a question about our products
        or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry. If you
        provide your personal information to purchase a product or service, we will use that
        information to process your payment and facilitate delivery. We may also save your
        information to facilitate new product orders or process returns.
      </li>
      <li>To provide, support, personalize, and develop our Service, products, and services.</li>
      <li>To create, maintain, customize, and secure your account with us.</li>

        held by the Company about our Service users is among the assets transferred.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will not collect additional categories of personal information or use the personal
      information we collected for materially different, unrelated, or incompatible purposes without
      providing you notice.
    </p>

    <h2>Sharing Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      We may disclose your personal information to a third party for a business purpose. When we
      disclose personal information for a business purpose, we enter a contract that describes the
      purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not
      use it for any purpose except performing the contract. The CCPA prohibits third parties who
      purchase the personal information we hold from reselling it unless you have received explicit
      notice and an opportunity to opt-out of further sales.

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>

      those rights.
    </p>

    <h3>Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection
      and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once we receive and confirm your
      verifiable consumer request (see
      <i>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</i>), we will disclose to you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The categories of personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.</li>
      <li>
        Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
      </li>
      <li>The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.</li>
      <li>
        The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data
        portability request).
      </li>
      <li>
        If we sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists
        disclosing:
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient
          purchased; and
        </li>
        <li>
          disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that
          each category of recipient obtained.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Deletion Request Rights</h3>
    <p>
      You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we
      collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm
      your verifiable consumer request (see
      <i>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</i>), we will delete (and direct
      our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an
      exception applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our
      service provider(s) to:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or
        service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our
        ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal
        activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech
        rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
      </li>

        Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546
        <i>et. seq.</i>).

      <li>
        Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the

        achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on

      <li>
        Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
    <p>
      To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a
      verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at
      <a href="mailto:support@modrinth.com">support@modrinth.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to
      act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal
      information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a
      12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about
        whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
      </li>
      <li>
        Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
        evaluate, and respond to it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify
      your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.
      However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently
      verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific
      account.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the
      requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see
      <i>Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights.</i>
    </p>

    <h3>Response Timing and Format</h3>
    <p>
      We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its
      receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and
      extension period in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you
      do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or
      electronically, at your option.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable
      consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
      comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format
      to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit
      the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is
      excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a
      fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before
      completing your request.
    </p>

    <h2>Non-Discrimination</h2>
    <p>
      We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted
      by the CCPA, we will not:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
      <li>
        Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting
        discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
      </li>
      <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
      <li>
        Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different
        level or quality of goods or services.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that
      <strong>can result</strong>
      in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer
      will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that
      describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program
      requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
    </p>
