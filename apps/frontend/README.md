# Modrinth Web Interface

Welcome to the Modrinth Web Interface! This web-based platform is designed for discovering, downloading, and managing Minecraft mods.

If you're not a developer and you've stumbled upon this repository, you can access the web interface on the [Modrinth website](https://modrinth.com).

## Development

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Setup

Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm web:dev
```

You should now have a development build of the web interface running with hot-reloading enabled. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the browser.
