# Modrinth Monorepo

This is the Modrinth monorepo — it contains all Modrinth projects, both frontend and backend. When entering a project, either to edit or analyse, you should read it's CLAUDE.md.

## Architecture

- **Monorepo tooling:** [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) (`turbo.jsonc`) + [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- **Frontend:** Vue 3 / Nuxt 3, Tailwind CSS v3
- **Backend:** Rust (Labrinth API), Postgres, Clickhouse
- **Indentation:** Use TAB everywhere, never spaces

## Pre-PR Commands

Run these from the **root** folder before opening a pull request - do not run these after each prompt the user gives you, only run when asked, ask the user a question if they want to run it if the user indicates that they are about to create a pull request.

- **Website:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:web`
- **App frontend:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:app`
- **Frontend libs:** `pnpm prepr:frontend:lib`
- **All frontend (app+web):** `pnpm prepr`
- **Labrinth (backend):** See `apps/labrinth/CLAUDE.md`

The website and app `prepr` commands

## Dev Commands

- **Website:** `pnpm web:dev` (copy `.env` template in `apps/frontend/` first)
- **App:** `pnpm app:dev` (copy `.env` template in `packages/app-lib/` first)
- **Storybook (packages/ui):** `pnpm storybook`

## Project-Specific Instructions

Each project may have its own `CLAUDE.md` with detailed instructions:

- [`apps/labrinth/CLAUDE.md`](apps/labrinth/CLAUDE.md) — Backend API
- [`apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md`](apps/frontend/CLAUDE.md) - Frontend Website

## Skills (`.claude/skills/`)

Task-oriented skills that reference the detailed standards in `standards/frontend/`:

- **`api-module`** — Create a new API endpoint module from an OpenAPI schema
- **`cross-platform-pages`** — Convert a page to the cross-platform shared/wrapped layout system
- **`i18n-pass`** — Perform an i18n localization pass on changed files or a PR
- **`figma-mcp`** — Draft a page layout from a Figma design using the MCP server
- **`tanstack-query`** — Convert a page from `useAsyncData` / manual fetching to TanStack Query

## Code Guidelines

### Comments
- DO NOT use "heading" comments like: `=== Helper methods ===`.
- Use doc comments, but avoid inline comments unless ABSOLUTELY necessary for clarity. Code should aim to be self documenting!

## Bash Guidelines

### Output handling
- DO NOT pipe output through `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `more`
- NEVER use `| head -n X` or `| tail -n X` to truncate output
- IMPORTANT: Run commands directly without pipes when possible
- IMPORTANT: If you need to limit output, use command-specific flags (e.g. `git log -n 10` instead of `git log | head -10`)
- ALWAYS read the full output — never pipe through filters

### General
- Do not create new non-source code files (e.g. Bash scripts, SQL scripts) unless explicitly prompted to
- For Frontend, when doing lint checks, only use the `prepr` commands, do not use `typecheck` or `tsc` etc.

## Edit Tool - Whitespace Handling (CLAUDE ONLY)

The Read tool uses `→` to mark where line numbers end and file content begins.

**Rule:** Copy the EXACT whitespace that appears after the `→` marker.
- Whatever appears between `→` and the code text is what's actually in the file
- That whitespace must be used EXACTLY in Edit tool's old_string
- Don't count arrows, don't interpret - just copy what's after the `→`

**Example:**
14→		private byte tag;
For Edit, use: `		private byte tag;` (copy everything after →, including the two tabs)

**If Edit fails:** Stop and explain the problem. Do not attempt sed/awk/bash workarounds.

**IMPORTANT**: Trust the Read tool output. Copy what's after `→` into Edit immediately. DO NOT verify with sed/od/grep first - that's wasting time and the instructions already tell you to stop if Edit fails, not to pre-verify.
